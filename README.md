# AllInOne
Laziness has one advantage that it helps me to come up with such ideas to make my life a bit simpler.

The code is a combination of three tools that I mostly prefer while enumerating a web application. The tools are here:
nmap
nikto
dirb

I will be adding more tools later to simplify most of my enumeration work at once. 

Note: The work is not completed once. The work is still in progress :)

Incase of any doubt, feel free to contact me at my twitter handle @freak_crypt
